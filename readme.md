# Ahead.Dockerized

I am one of the lead developers who develop ahead intranet, [the digital home](https://aheadintranet.com) for countless employees mostly across the DACH (Germany, Austrie, Switzerland) region.

This repository holds the code relevant to the blog series [starting here](https://realfiction.net/posts/depending-on-a-color/) on my website.

The basic premise is this: 

> Considering the architecture of the product ahead, which services would one use, and how, to reduce dependncies on Azure PaaS services
to the point where one could host the product outside of Azure?
